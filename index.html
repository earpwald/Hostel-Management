          <h1>About Kathy</h1>

          <div class="post-content">
            <h3>Kathy Hutton - Director</h3>
            <img class="bioPhoto" src="img/kathy.jpg" /><p class="bio">Kathy is a local from the Bay of Islands, where she grew up working on her fathers farm.  Since then she has been involved in various different employment sectors.  Most recently she was the manager at Saltwater Lodge and has decided to move on to try new things.  She is a supporter of the local community and believes in working together to achieve a better life for all.  To that end she has decided to set up a new enterprise to support the local tourism industry.</p><p>

            Many hostels, motels and hotels in the area are each run by a few key people which means that they need to be on-site for the majority of the year.  It often leads to managers being over worked or finding it difficult to have quality time away from the business to rejuvinate themselves.  Kathy is offering a new service which she hopes will provide these managers with an opportunity to get some R&amp;R.  By working alongside the existing management, she will temporarily run the accomodation, as it has been by its managers, to allow them time off.  She will spend some time with the managers beforehand to learn their way of running THEIR enterprise, and will then run it accordingly.  The best parts:
            <ul>
              <li>Once you've used her service once, the amount of time that you need to spend beforehand is greatly reduced</li>
              <li>Payment will be by invoice, so you don't need to worry with the hassle of hiring an employee temporarily</li>
            </ul>

            This is Kathy's community and she is a trusted and respected member in it.  <br/><br/>

            For three years, Kathy and her partner Kevin sailed around the north west pacific on their yacht.  Whilst travelling she also engaged in a variety of different jobs to support their lifestyle.  Together, they are part of the local yachting community with an established business in <a href="http://garhauer.co.nz">marine hardware</a>.  She has teamed up with an IT guru to start providing <a href="signum.nz">local solutions for local people</a>.  In her spare time she enjoys spending time with her family and grandkids, reading and sailing.<br/><br/>
