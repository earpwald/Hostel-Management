          <h1>Kathy's Résumé</h1>
          <br/>

          <div class="post-content">
            Kathy has has been inviolved in a variety of different business, both within and outside the torusim industry which has provided her with the necessary skills.  These can be seen below, but a more in-depth CV can be provided upon request.
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Farm work on parents farm</h4>This reinforced the values of putting in a hard days work, organisation and team work from a young age</li>
              <li><h4>Catamaran discos in Tel-Aviv</h4>This was first experience in the toursit industry and was an introduction to dealing with people of different nationalities face to face and sales and marketing</li>
              <li><h4>Sailing Charters from Egypt, Israel, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey</h4>Was a difficult but enjoyable post as each chartered trip could last anywhere from several days to several weeks.  I learned a lot here about ensuring that everyone enjoyed themselves, but also in reasoning with people to prevent them from causing accidents or upsetting other guests.</li>
              <li><h4>Tour guide in Egypt</h4>This was a short position but an eye opener.  My first day on the job I was expected to take a group of tourists to the Pyramids, which I had never done before.  I learned a lot about thinking quickly on my feet and working under pressure.</li>
              <li><h4>Diving and sailing charters in the Red Sea</h4>Diving is a high pressure job.  You often have to deal with novices who believe that they are impervious to the dangers of diving.  People quite literally, put their lives in your hands.</li>
              <li><h4>Administration and Management - Bakery</h4>Although not tourist related, the sales and management here was all done over the telephone.  I had to be capable of making decisions quickly and often had to diffuse explosive situations with customers.</li>
              <li><h4>Clothing Factory &amp; Outlets - Restructure, Administration and Public Relations</h4>This was a startup and I had to build up the administration component to the business from scratch.  I often worked with clients as well as over the counter customers to ensure sales.</li>
              <li><h4>Farm</h4>Pyshical, Book work and all levels of organisation</li>
              <li><h4>Car Rental - Scheduling and Sales</h4>Here I dealt with tourist bookings over the phone as well as providing clients with support in case of emergency.  Also had to schedule car runs from depots to return vehicles to the appropriate place.</li>
              <li><h4>NGO - Canoes of the Marchall Islands</h4>Non Government Organisation while living in Marshall Islands.  I was the Associate Director and had to write for local and international financial grants, plan for daily budgets and run the tourist museum.</li>
              <li><h4>Home Support North</h4>This was a community driven goal which allowed me to meet local people within the community and provide them with the help they needed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the job and still keep in touch with the people I was associated with.</li>
              <li><h4>Management of Saltwater Lodge</h4>I was employed initially part time and after a couple of months, the previous managers left unexpectedly and I stepped in and took over the management.  When I inherited the lodge, I had to learn all the levels of management which often meant that I had to find a new and improved way to work.  I thoroughly enjoyed the success of having guests return because of us and the relationships that we built with our woofing staff. One key success for my time at the lodge was the loyalty of the tour groups that came to the area.  We found that many liked the new practises and the level of attention that they recieved and built up a good working relationship with them.</li>
              <li><h4><a href="signum.nz">SigNum IT</a> and <a href="garhauer.co.nz">Garhauer Marine Hardware</a></h4>These are an on-going development which I am keen to promote.  Garhauer Marine Hardware, run by Kevin, my partner, has proven to be a growing business opportunity for the yachting community and SigNum IT is a software development enterprise I have started with an IT Guru who helped to redesign the Saltwater Lodge website.</li>
